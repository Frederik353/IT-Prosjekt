              Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
              released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
              Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
              large-scale projects

            <p>
              Web-based developers will be unlikely to consider C when building a web-based application. There are three primary
              reasons: First, C predates the modern Internet and was never designed for web-based development. Second, C is a
              low-level language with verbose syntax, which doesn't lend itself to rapidly building a web-based application. Third, a
              popular web-based framework has never emerged for developers.

              efficient management of dependencies. This language also supports environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic

              This programming language views the world as a group of objects that have internal data and external accessing parts of
              that data. The aim this programming language is to think about the fault by separating it into a collection of objects
              that offer services which can be used to solve a specific problem. One of the main principle of object oriented
              programming language is encapsulation that everything an object will need must be inside of the object. This language
              also emphasizes reusability through inheritance and the capacity to spread current implementations without having to
              change a great deal of code by using polymorphism.

              Functional programming language typically uses stored data, frequently avoiding loops in favor of recursive
              functions.The functional programing’s primary focus is on the return values of functions, and side effects and different
              suggests that storing state are powerfully discouraged. For example, in an exceedingly pure useful language, if a
              function is termed, it’s expected that the function not modify or perform any o/p. It may, however, build algorithmic
              calls and alter the parameters of these calls. Functional languages are usually easier and build it easier to figure on
              abstract issues, however, they’ll even be “further from the machine” therein their programming model makes it difficult
              to know precisely, but the code is decoded into machine language (which are often problematic for system programming).

              pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application
              features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation,

              The Internet Protocol (IP) is the principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying
              datagrams across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and essentially establishes the
              Internet.
              IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination host solely based on the IP addresses in
              the packet headers. For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be delivered. It also
              defines addressing methods that are used to label the datagram with source and destination information.

              Linuxis a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first
              released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
              Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the
              GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name
              GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.

              projects with speed and efficiency.
              Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion,
              CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

    <p>
      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web
      document
      (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS
      comes
      through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of
      HTML
      as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a
      Victorian
      mansion and a mid-century modern home).

      HTML is a type of markup language. It encapsulates, or “marks up” data within HTML tags, which define the data and
      describe its purpose on the webpage. The web browser then reads the HTML, which tells it things like which parts
      are
      headings, which parts are paragraphs, which parts are links, etc. The HTML describes the data to the browser, and
      the
      browser then displays the data accordingly.

      pygame is a Python wrapper for the SDL library, which stands for Simple DirectMedia Layer. SDL provides
      cross-platform
      access to your system’s underlying multimedia hardware components, such as sound, video, mouse, keyboard, and
      joystick.
      pygame started life as a replacement for the stalled PySDL project. The cross-platform nature of both SDL and

      means you can write games and rich multimedia Python programs for every platform that supports them!

      One of the most popular Python data science libraries, Scrapy helps to build crawling programs (spider bots) that

      for example, Python machine learning models.
      Developers use it for gathering data from APIs. This full-fledged framework follows the Don't Repeat Yourself
      principle
      in the design of its interface. As a result, the tool inspires users to write universal code that can be reused
      for
      building and scaling large crawlers.

      <h2>Application Programming interfaces</h2>

    <p>
      The term API is an acronym, and it stands for “Application Programming Interface.”
      Think of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a
      description
      of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant’s kitchen does the work and provides you
      with
      some finished dishes. You don’t know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don’t really need to.
      Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do.
      The
      developer doesn’t necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a “Save As”
      dialog
      box. They just need to know that it’s available for use in their app.

      Laravel is primarily used for building custom web apps using PHP. It’s a web framework that handles many things

      annoying to build yourself, such as routing, templating HTML, and authentication. Laravel is entirely server-side,
      due
      to running on PHP, and focuses heavily on data manipulation and sticking to a Model-View-Controller design. A
      framework
      like React might put most of its attention on user interaction and shiny features, but Laravel simply presents a

      NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array
      operations.
      The library offers many handy features performing operations on n-arrays and matrices in Python. It helps to
      process
      arrays that store values of the same data type and makes performing math operations on arrays (and their
      vectorization)
      easier. In fact, the vectorization of mathematical operations on the NumPy array type increases performance and
      accelerates the execution time.

      This is a standard data science library that helps to generate data visualizations such as two-dimensional
      diagrams and
      graphs (histograms, scatterplots, non-Cartesian coordinates graphs). Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries
      that
      are really useful in data science projects — it provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into
      applications.
      It's thanks to this library that Python can compete with scientific tools like MatLab or Mathematica. However,
      developers need to write more code than usual while using this library for generating advanced visualizations.
      Note that
      popular plotting libraries work seamlessly with Matplotlib.
